#Wolfram Bridge

This repository contains examples of smart contracts that leverage the bridge of real-world data as input for desentralized applications. This bridge plays a crucial role enabling applications to interact with off-chain information.

## Introduction

Smart contracts often require external data to perform certain functions or make decisions. Our service will act as a bridge between smart contracts and the external world, providing reliable data from off-chain sources. This repository aims to showcase prototypes built for different blockchains that use external data to execute.

## Prototype Examples

### 1. Marlowe

### 2. Tezos

### 3. Stellar 
Importantly, this is just a fork of an existing 'oracle.' We have only worked on a European Call example here, without modifying the original oracle.
